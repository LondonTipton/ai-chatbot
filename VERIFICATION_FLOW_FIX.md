# Email Verification Flow - Fixed Issues

## Problems Resolved

### 1. Email Address Disappears on Page Reload

**Issue**: When a user registered and was redirected to the verify-pending page, if they refreshed the browser or closed and reopened it, the email address would disappear.

**Solution**:

- Added localStorage persistence for the email address
- Email is stored when the user object loads and retrieved on page reload
- Key: `pending-verification-email`

### 2. Resend Email Button Fails

**Issue**: When the email disappeared, clicking "Resend Verification Email" would fail because there was no email to send to.

**Solution**:

- Added validation to check if email is available before attempting resend
- Shows user-friendly error message if email is not available
- Suggests logging in again if the session is completely lost

### 3. Sign Out Button Not Working

**Issue**: The sign out button on the verify-pending page wasn't properly clearing the session and redirecting.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced logout handler with multiple fallback mechanisms:
  1. Clears localStorage email
  2. Calls auth context logout
  3. Calls server-side logout API to clear cookies
  4. Forces redirect using `window.location.href` for reliability
- Added loading state to prevent multiple clicks
- Even if logout fails, ensures local state is cleared and user is redirected

### 4. Middleware Handling for Verify-Pending

**Issue**: The verify-pending page wasn't properly protected - users without sessions could access it, leading to errors.

**Solution**:

- Made verify-pending a semi-protected route (requires session but not verification)
- Added explicit redirect to login if no session exists
- Allows users with valid sessions to access the page regardless of verification status
- Properly handles the case where verified users land on verify-pending (redirects to home)

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

1. **app/(auth)/verify-pending/page.tsx**

   - Added localStorage persistence for email
   - Enhanced logout handler with multiple fallback mechanisms
   - Added loading states for both resend and logout actions
   - Improved error handling and user feedback

2. **middleware.ts**
   - Separated verify-pending from public routes
   - Added explicit handling for verify-pending route
   - Ensures users without sessions are redirected to login
   - Updated matcher config to include verify-pending

## User Experience Improvements

- Users can now safely refresh the verify-pending page without losing their email
- Sign out button reliably logs users out and redirects to login
- Clear error messages guide users when issues occur
- Loading states provide feedback during async operations
- Proper session validation prevents access without authentication

## Testing Recommendations

1. Register a new account and verify the email is displayed
2. Refresh the page and confirm email persists
3. Click "Resend Verification Email" and verify it works
4. Click "Sign Out" and verify redirect to login
5. Try accessing /verify-pending without a session (should redirect to login)
6. Verify an email and try accessing /verify-pending (should redirect to home)
