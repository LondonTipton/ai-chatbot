# Freemium Model Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- Added `plan` column to User table (enum: Free, Basic, Pro, Pro+, Ultra)
- Added `requestsToday` column to track daily usage
- Added `dailyRequestLimit` column (default: 5 for Free tier)
- Added `lastRequestReset` column to track when counter resets
- Migration successfully applied to database

### 2. Usage Tracking System

**File:** `lib/db/usage.ts`

- `checkAndIncrementUsage()` - Checks and increments user's daily request count
- `getUserUsage()` - Gets current usage stats without incrementing
- `updateUserPlan()` - Updates user's plan and daily limits
- Automatic daily reset at midnight UTC

**Daily Limits by Plan:**

- Free: 5 requests/day
- Basic: 50 requests/day
- Pro: 200 requests/day
- Pro+: 600 requests/day
- Ultra: 4000 requests/day

### 3. API Integration

**File:** `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts`

- Integrated usage checking before processing chat requests
- Returns 429 status with usage info when limit reached
- Logs usage stats for monitoring

**File:** `app/api/usage/current/route.ts`

- New endpoint to get current usage stats
- Returns: requestsToday, dailyLimit, plan, remaining, percentage

### 4. UI Components

**Usage Indicator** (`components/usage-indicator.tsx`)

- Shows progress bar with current usage
- Color-coded: green → yellow → red as limit approaches
- Displays "Upgrade" button when near limit
- Tooltip with detailed info

**Upgrade Modal** (`components/upgrade-modal.tsx`)

- Triggered when daily limit is reached
- Shows recommended plan based on current tier
- Lists features of recommended plan
- Links to pricing page
- Explains daily reset time

**Chat Header** (`components/chat-header.tsx`)

- Integrated usage indicator
- Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Shows real-time usage stats

**Chat Component** (`components/chat.tsx`)

- Error handling for rate limit errors
- Automatically shows upgrade modal when limit reached
- Parses error messages to extract usage data

### 5. Pricing Page Updates

**File:** `app/(auth)/pricing/page.tsx`

- Added Free tier as first option
- Updated all plan descriptions with daily limits
- Free tier button links to /register
- Paid tier buttons link to /checkout

**Free Tier Features:**

- 5 AI requests per day
- Basic model access
- Artifact generation
- Community support

### 6. User Registration Flow

- New users automatically get Free plan
- Email verification still required (unchanged)
- Can start using app immediately after verification
- Usage tracking starts from first request

## 🔄 User Flow

### New User Journey

1. User visits landing page
2. Clicks "Start Free" on pricing page
3. Registers with email/password
4. Receives verification email
5. Clicks verification link
6. Redirected to app with Free plan (5 requests/day)
7. Can start chatting immediately
8. Usage indicator shows remaining requests
9. When limit reached, sees upgrade modal
10. Can upgrade to paid plan or wait for daily reset

### Existing User Journey

1. Existing users automatically get Free plan
2. Usage counter starts from 0
3. Can continue using app with daily limits
4. Upgrade prompts appear when approaching limit

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

- Free to paid conversion rate
- Daily active users by plan
- Average requests per user
- Upgrade modal views vs conversions
- Time to first upgrade
- Churn rate by plan

### Database Queries for Analytics

```sql
-- Users by plan
SELECT plan, COUNT(*) FROM "User" GROUP BY plan;

-- Daily usage stats
SELECT
  plan,
  AVG(CAST("requestsToday" AS INTEGER)) as avg_requests,
  MAX(CAST("requestsToday" AS INTEGER)) as max_requests
FROM "User"
GROUP BY plan;

-- Users hitting limits
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "User"
WHERE CAST("requestsToday" AS INTEGER) >= CAST("dailyRequestLimit" AS INTEGER);
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - Onboarding

- [ ] Add welcome tutorial for new users
- [ ] Show feature highlights
- [ ] Guided first chat experience
- [ ] Tips for getting most value

### Phase 3 - Conversion Optimization

- [ ] A/B test different daily limits
- [ ] Test upgrade modal messaging
- [ ] Add social proof (testimonials)
- [ ] Implement referral program
- [ ] Add trial period for paid plans

### Phase 4 - Advanced Features

- [ ] Team/organization plans
- [ ] Usage analytics dashboard for users
- [ ] Custom plan builder
- [ ] Annual billing with discount
- [ ] Multiple payment methods (Stripe, PayPal)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [x] Database migration successful
- [ ] New user registration creates Free plan
- [ ] Usage counter increments on chat request
- [ ] Usage counter resets at midnight UTC
- [ ] Upgrade modal appears when limit reached
- [ ] Usage indicator shows correct stats
- [ ] Pricing page displays Free tier
- [ ] Free tier button links to registration
- [ ] Paid tier buttons link to checkout

### Edge Cases to Test

- [ ] User at exactly 5 requests
- [ ] User tries to chat after limit
- [ ] Multiple requests in quick succession
- [ ] Timezone handling for daily reset
- [ ] User upgrades mid-day (counter should adjust)
- [ ] Database connection errors
- [ ] API timeout handling

## 📝 Configuration

### Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. Uses existing:

- `POSTGRES_URL` - Database connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_*` - Authentication

### Database Maintenance

- Daily reset happens automatically via application logic
- No cron jobs required
- Consider adding index on `lastRequestReset` for performance

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Daily Reset Timing**: Resets at midnight UTC, not user's local timezone

   - Future: Add timezone support per user

2. **Usage Tracking**: Counts all chat requests equally

   - Future: Consider token-based limits instead

3. **Upgrade Flow**: Requires manual payment process

   - Future: Implement instant upgrade with Stripe

4. **No Grace Period**: Hard limit at 5 requests
   - Future: Consider allowing 1-2 extra requests with warning

## 📚 Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] Update README with freemium model info
- [ ] Add API documentation for usage endpoints
- [ ] Create user guide for plan limits
- [ ] Document upgrade process
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
