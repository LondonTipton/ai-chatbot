# Tavily Integration - Final Summary

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Your DeepCounsel application now has **full web search and content extraction capabilities** powered by Tavily. The AI can automatically search for legal cases, extract full document content, and create document artifacts - all without requiring any MCP server setup.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & PRODUCTION-READY**

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Integration (REST API, not MCP)

**Why REST API instead of MCP?**

- MCP servers require persistent connections (incompatible with Vercel serverless)
- MCP is designed for local AI assistants (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Kiro)
- REST API works perfectly with Next.js serverless functions
- Simpler, more secure, and production-ready

### 2. Two Powerful Tools

#### `tavilySearch` - Web Search

- Searches for legal cases, statutes, news, current information
- Filters by domain (e.g., only `.gov` or `.org` sites)
- Returns structured results with relevance scores
- Includes AI-generated answer summaries
- **Cost:** 1 credit (basic) or 2 credits (advanced)

#### `tavilyExtract` - Content Extraction

- Extracts clean, full content from URLs
- Returns markdown or plain text
- Perfect for court cases, legal documents, articles
- Batch extraction (up to 5 URLs)
- **Cost:** 1 credit per URL

### 3. Automatic Multi-Tool Workflows

The AI automatically chains tools together:

```
User asks about a court case
    ↓
AI searches with tavilySearch
    ↓
AI extracts full content with tavilyExtract
    ↓
AI creates document artifact with full case
    ↓
AI creates second document with analysis
    ↓
AI responds with citations and sources
```

**No user intervention needed** - the AI orchestrates everything.

### 4. Smart System Prompts

The AI knows to:

- Search proactively (doesn't ask for full citations first)
- Use partial information (case names, party names, topics)
- Filter by authoritative domains for legal research
- Extract full content when needed
- Create multiple documents (source + analysis)
- Cite sources with URLs
- Handle errors gracefully

## How It Works

### Example: Legal Case Research

**User:** "Find and summarize the Brown v. Board of Education case"

**Behind the Scenes:**

1. **AI analyzes request**

   - Recognizes need for web search
   - Identifies legal case query

2. **AI calls tavilySearch**

   ```typescript
   tavilySearch({
     query: "Brown Board Education supreme court",
     searchDepth: "advanced",
     maxResults: 7,
     includeDomains: ["supremecourt.gov", "law.cornell.edu"],
   });
   ```

   - Returns 7 relevant URLs
   - Includes content snippets
   - Provides relevance scores

3. **AI calls tavilyExtract**

   ```typescript
   tavilyExtract({
     urls: [top_url],
     format: "markdown",
     extractDepth: "advanced",
   });
   ```

   - Gets full case text
   - Cleans and formats as markdown
   - Preserves document structure

4. **AI calls createDocument (twice)**

   ```typescript
   createDocument({
     title: "Brown v. Board of Education - Full Text",
     kind: "text",
   });
   // Full case text appears in artifact panel

   createDocument({
     title: "Case Summary & Key Holdings",
     kind: "text",
   });
   // Analysis appears in second artifact
   ```

5. **AI responds to user**

   ```
   "I've found the case and created two documents for you:

   1. Full case text from the Supreme Court
   2. Summary of key holdings and significance

   The case established that..."

   Sources:
   - https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/
   ```

**Total cost:** 3-4 credits (out of 1,000/month free tier)

## Key Features

### ✅ Proactive Search

- AI searches immediately with available information
- Doesn't ask for full citations before searching
- Uses partial case names, party names, or topics
- Refines search based on results

### ✅ Domain Filtering

For Zimbabwean legal research:

```typescript
includeDomains: [
  "zimlii.org", // Zimbabwe Legal Information Institute
  "gov.zw", // Government sites
  "parlzim.gov.zw", // Parliament
  "southernafricalitigationcentre.org", // Regional legal resources
];
```

### ✅ Multi-Document Creation

- Full source document (extracted content)
- Analysis/summary document
- Both visible in artifact panel
- User can reference, edit, or export

### ✅ Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if API key missing
- Rate limit detection and messaging
- Authentication error handling
- Continues conversation even if search fails

### ✅ Security

- API key server-side only (never exposed to browser)
- No CORS issues (server-to-server calls)
- No OAuth complexity (simple API key)
- Vercel environment variables encrypted

## Testing

### Quick Tests

1. **Basic Search**

   ```
   "Search for Zimbabwe Labour Act amendments"
   ```

   Expected: Search results with sources

2. **Case Research**

   ```
   "Find the Bowers v Minister of Lands case"
   ```

   Expected: Search → Extract → 2 documents created

3. **Constitutional Lookup**
   ```
   "What does Section 71 of the Constitution say?"
   ```
   Expected: Search → Extract → Document with full text

See `TAVILY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive test suite.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment Steps

1. **Add Environment Variable**

   ```
   Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Deploy**

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Test in Production**
   - Try a search query
   - Verify document creation
   - Check error handling

See `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed steps.

## Monitoring

### Tavily Dashboard

https://app.tavily.com

**Monitor:**

- Credits used
- Credits remaining
- Request success rate
- Response times

**Set Alerts:**

- Email at 80% usage
- Monitor for spikes
- Track failed requests

### Vercel Analytics

**Monitor:**

- API route performance
- Error rates
- Response times
- User activity

---

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Caching (Recommended)

```typescript
// Cache search results for 1 hour
const cacheKey = `tavily:${query}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

// ... perform search ...

await redis.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(results), "EX", 3600);
```

**Benefit:** Reduce API calls by 50-70% for common queries

### 2. Usage Tracking

```typescript
// Track per-user usage
await trackTavilyUsage({
  userId: session.user.id,
  action: "search",
  credits: searchDepth === "advanced" ? 2 : 1,
});
```

**Benefit:** Identify heavy users, prevent abuse

### 3. Rate Limiting

```typescript
// Limit searches per user per day
const userSearchCount = await getUserSearchCount(userId);
if (userSearchCount > 20) {
  return new Response("Daily search limit reached", { status: 429 });
}
```

**Benefit:** Control costs, prevent abuse

### 4. Smart Search Depth

```typescript
// Use basic for simple queries, advanced for complex
const searchDepth =
  query.length > 50 || query.includes("case law") ? "advanced" : "basic";
```

**Benefit:** Reduce costs by 50% on simple queries
