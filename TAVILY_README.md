## How It Works

```
User asks about a court case
    ↓
AI searches with tavilySearch (1-2 credits)
    ↓
AI extracts full content with tavilyExtract (1 credit)
    ↓
AI creates document artifact with full case
    ↓
AI creates second document with analysis
    ↓
AI responds with citations and sources
```

**Total cost:** 3-4 credits per research query  
**Free tier:** 1,000 credits/month = ~250 research queries

---

## Key Features

### Proactive Search

AI searches immediately with partial information - no need for full citations

### Domain Filtering

Prioritizes authoritative sources:

- `zimlii.org` - Zimbabwe Legal Information Institute
- `gov.zw` - Government sites
- `parlzim.gov.zw` - Parliament

### Multi-Document Creation

- Full source document (extracted content)
- Analysis/summary document
- Both in artifact panel

### Error Handling

Graceful fallback if search fails - conversation continues

---

## Architecture

### Why REST API (Not MCP)?

❌ **MCP Server** - Requires persistent connections, incompatible with Vercel  
✅ **REST API** - Works perfectly with serverless, simpler, more secure

### File Structure

```
lib/ai/tools/
├── tavily-search.ts       # Search tool
└── tavily-extract.ts      # Extract tool

lib/ai/
└── prompts.ts             # System prompts

app/(chat)/api/chat/
└── route.ts               # Tools registered

.env.local                 # TAVILY_API_KEY
```

---

## Cost & Usage

### Free Tier

- 1,000 API credits/month
- No credit card required
- All features available

### Credit Usage

- Basic search: 1 credit
- Advanced search: 2 credits
- Extract per URL: 1 credit

### Typical Workflow

- Search (2 credits) + Extract (1 credit) = **3 credits**
- 1,000 credits = **~300 research queries/month**

---

## Security

✅ API key server-side only (never exposed to browser)  
✅ No CORS issues (server-to-server calls)  
✅ No OAuth complexity (simple API key)  
✅ Vercel environment variables encrypted  
✅ Standard Next.js security applies

---

## Monitoring

### Tavily Dashboard

https://app.tavily.com

Monitor:

- Credits used/remaining
- Request success rate
- Response times

### Vercel Analytics

Monitor:

- API route performance
- Error rates
- User activity

---

## Troubleshooting

### "TAVILY_API_KEY is not configured"

```bash
# Add to .env.local
echo 'TAVILY_API_KEY=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' >> .env.local
pnpm dev
```

### Search doesn't trigger

- Query must be about legal cases or current information
- Try: "Search for [your query]"

### Extract fails

- Some sites block scraping
- Try different URL from search results

**More help:** See troubleshooting sections in documentation
