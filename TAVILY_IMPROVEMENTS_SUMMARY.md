# Tavily Search Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all improvements made to fix the Tavily search integration issues.

## Problems Identified

1. ❌ AI asking for more information instead of searching
2. ❌ AI requiring full citations before searching
3. ❌ Not performing multi-turn queries effectively
4. ❌ Poor error handling
5. ❌ Unclear when to use search vs. training data

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts (`lib/ai/prompts.ts`)

**Key Changes:**

- Added **"SEARCH FIRST, ASK LATER"** directive
- Explicit instructions to search with partial information
- Multi-turn search strategy guidelines
- Example interactions showing correct behavior
- Clear DO/DON'T lists

**Before:**

```typescript
"Use this when you need up-to-date information...";
```

**After:**

```typescript
"CRITICAL: Your Primary Directive for Tool Usage
When users ask about ANY legal matter - SEARCH FIRST, ASK LATER.
Do not request more information before searching..."
```

### 2. Improved Tool Description (`lib/ai/tools/tavily-search.ts`)

**Key Changes:**

- More aggressive description: "ALWAYS use this tool when..."
- Explicit examples of when to search
- Clear instruction: "DO NOT ask users for more details before searching"
- Better query parameter descriptions

**Before:**

```typescript
description: "Search the web for current information...";
```

**After:**

```typescript
description: "Search the web for current legal information...
ALWAYS use this tool when users ask about: specific court cases
(with or without full citations)... DO NOT ask users for more
details before searching - search first with available information..."
```

### 3. Better Error Handling (`lib/ai/tools/tavily-search.ts`)

**Key Changes:**

- Graceful error returns instead of throwing
- Specific error messages for common issues (401, 403, 429)
- Helpful guidance in error messages
- Fallback to training data when search fails

**Before:**

```typescript
throw new Error(`Failed to perform web search...`);
```

**After:**

```typescript
return {
  query,
  answer: "Search failed: [helpful message]",
  results: [],
  error: "Authentication error",
};
```

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**Created:**

- `LEGAL_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md` - How to handle legal queries
- `TAVILY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `TAVILY_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This document

**Updated:**

- `TAVILY_SEARCH_INTEGRATION.md` - Enhanced with examples
- `TAVILY_QUICK_START.md` - Simplified setup

### 5. Test Endpoint (`app/api/test/tavily/route.ts`)

**Features:**

- Verify API key configuration
- Test API connectivity
- Check key format
- Provide helpful error messages
- Return sample results

**Usage:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test/tavily
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### Scenario 1: Partial Case Reference

**User:** "Tell me about the Bowers case"

**AI Behavior:**

1. ✅ Immediately searches: "Bowers Zimbabwe court case"
2. ✅ Presents results with citations
3. ✅ Offers to search for more details
4. ❌ Does NOT ask for full citation first

### Scenario 2: General Legal Topic

**User:** "What are the requirements for company registration?"

**AI Behavior:**

1. ✅ Searches: "Zimbabwe company registration requirements"
2. ✅ Includes official domains: ["gov.zw", "zimlii.org"]
3. ✅ Presents current requirements with sources
4. ❌ Does NOT rely solely on training data

### Scenario 3: Multi-Turn Research

**User:** "Find cases about property rights"
**AI:** [Searches and presents results]
**User:** "Tell me more about the first case"

**AI Behavior:**

1. ✅ Performs second search with case details
2. ✅ Refines query based on first search results
3. ✅ Synthesizes information from both searches
4. ❌ Does NOT ask user to repeat information

### Scenario 4: Search Error

**User:** "Search for recent amendments"

**If API key missing:**

```
I attempted to search for current information, but the search
service is not configured. Based on my training data: [answer]

Note: For current information, please ensure TAVILY_API_KEY is configured.
```

**If rate limit exceeded:**

```
I've reached the search limit. Based on my training data: [answer]

For current information, please check:
- zimlii.org
- gov.zw
```

## Testing the Improvements

### 1. Test API Configuration

```bash
# Visit test endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test/tavily

# Expected response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "✅ Tavily API is working correctly!",
  "resultCount": 2
}
```

### 2. Test Search Behavior

**Test 1: Partial Information**

```
User: "Tell me about the Bowers case"
Expected: Immediate search, no request for more info
```

**Test 2: Multi-Turn**

```
User: "Find property rights cases"
AI: [Results]
User: "Analyze the first one"
Expected: Second search with refined query
```

**Test 3: Error Handling**

```
# Temporarily remove API key
Expected: Graceful error, fallback to training data
```

### 3. Verify System Prompts

Check `lib/ai/prompts.ts` contains:

- ✅ "SEARCH FIRST, ASK LATER"
- ✅ Multi-turn strategy
- ✅ Example interactions
- ✅ DO/DON'T lists

### 4. Verify Tool Description

Check `lib/ai/tools/tavily-search.ts` contains:

- ✅ "ALWAYS use this tool when..."
- ✅ "DO NOT ask users for more details..."
- ✅ Better query examples

## Performance Improvements

### Query Optimization

**Before:**

```typescript
query: "case"; // Too vague
```

**After:**

```typescript
query: "Bowers Minister of Lands Zimbabwe ZWCC"; // Specific
```

### Search Depth Selection

**Simple queries:**

```typescript
searchDepth: "basic"; // Faster
```

**Complex research:**

```typescript
searchDepth: "advanced"; // More thorough
```

### Domain Filtering

**Official sources:**

```typescript
includeDomains: ["gov.zw", "zimlii.org", "parlzim.gov.zw"];
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Check Search Usage

```bash
# View Gemini stats (includes tool calls)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/gemini-stats

# Check Tavily dashboard
# Visit: tavily.com/dashboard
```

### Common Issues to Monitor

1. **High search failure rate** → Check API key and rate limits
2. **Slow responses** → Use basic search depth
3. **Irrelevant results** → Improve query construction
4. **No results** → Broaden queries or remove domain filters

### Update Checklist

When updating the system:

- [ ] Test with partial information queries
- [ ] Verify multi-turn conversations work
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Confirm citations are included
- [ ] Test with API key removed (graceful degradation)
