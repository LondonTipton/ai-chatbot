# Critical Fix Applied - Redirect Loop Resolution

## Issue

The application was stuck in an infinite redirect loop, creating hundreds of guest users and preventing the app from loading.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Cookie Name Mismatch:**
   - Middleware was looking for: `a_session_{projectId}`
   - Guest route was setting: `appwrite-session`
2. **Cookie Value Incorrect:**

   - Should use `session.secret` (the actual session token)
   - Was using `session.$id` (just the session ID)

3. **Middleware Intercepting API Routes:**
   - Middleware was processing `/api/auth/guest` requests
   - This caused the redirect to be intercepted before the cookie could be set

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Guest Route Cookie Setting (`app/api/auth/guest/route.ts`)

```typescript
// Now uses Appwrite's native cookie name
const sessionCookieName = `a_session_${projectId}`;

// Sets cookie with session.secret (the actual token)
response.cookies.set(sessionCookieName, session.secret, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  sameSite: "strict",
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 365, // 1 year
  path: "/",
});
```

### 2. Updated Middleware Configuration (`middleware.ts`)

```typescript
// Excluded API routes from middleware processing
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/",
    "/chat/:id",
    "/login",
    "/register",
    "/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|sitemap.xml|robots.txt).*)",
  ],
};
```

### 3. Added Redirect Loop Prevention (`middleware.ts`)

```typescript
// Check if we just came from guest route to prevent infinite loop
const referer = request.headers.get("referer");
const isFromGuestRoute = referer?.includes("/api/auth/guest");

if (isFromGuestRoute) {
  console.error(
    "[middleware] No session after guest route - possible cookie issue"
  );
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User visits app without session:**

   - Middleware detects no session
   - Redirects to `/api/auth/guest?redirectUrl=...`

2. **Guest route creates session:**

   - Creates anonymous session in Appwrite
   - Creates guest user in database
   - Sets Appwrite session cookie with correct name and value
   - Redirects back to original URL

3. **Middleware processes redirect:**

   - Now excluded from processing `/api/auth/guest`
   - Sees the session cookie on the redirected request
   - Validates session with Appwrite
   - Allows request through

4. **App loads successfully:**
   - User has valid guest session
   - Can use the app
   - Can upgrade to registered user later

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear browser data:**

   ```
   - Clear all cookies for localhost:3000
   - Clear local storage
   - Close all tabs
   ```

2. **Restart dev server:**

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Test guest session:**

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Should see ONE guest user created in Appwrite console
   - App should load successfully
   - User menu should show "Guest"

4. **Test registration:**

   - Click "Login to your account" in user menu
   - Navigate to register page
   - Create account with email/password
   - Should auto-login after registration

5. **Test login:**
   - Logout
   - Login with registered credentials
   - Should see email in user menu

## Verification

Check Appwrite console:

- Should see ONE new anonymous session (not hundreds)
- Session should have `provider: "anonymous"`
- User should have the session ID you see in browser cookies

Check browser cookies:

- Should have cookie named `a_session_{your-project-id}`
- Cookie value should be a long string (the session secret)
- Cookie should be httpOnly, secure (in production), sameSite: strict

## Status

✅ Database schema updated with `appwriteId` column
✅ Migrations applied successfully  
✅ Appwrite integration working (users being created)
✅ Cookie name and value fixed
✅ Middleware configuration fixed to exclude API routes
✅ Redirect loop prevention added

## Next Steps

1. Restart the dev server
2. Clear browser cookies
3. Test the application
4. If working, proceed with running the test suite

## If Issues Persist

If you still see redirect loops:

1. Check the dev server logs for errors
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check Appwrite console for session creation
5. Use browser dev tools to inspect cookies being set

The fix addresses the root causes. The application should now work correctly.
