# Chat History 404 Fix

## Problem

When users tried to open old chat histories, they were getting a 404 Not Found error. This was happening because the chat ownership check was comparing the wrong user IDs.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred due to a mismatch between user ID types:

1. **Session User ID**: The `session.user.id` contains the **Appwrite user ID** (from the authentication service)
2. **Chat User ID**: The `chat.userId` in the database contains the **database UUID** (internal database user ID)

When the code checked `if (session.user.id !== chat.userId)`, it was comparing an Appwrite ID with a database UUID, which would never match, causing all private chats to return 404.

## Solution

Updated `app/(chat)/chat/[id]/page.tsx` to properly resolve the user ID:

1. Look up the database user record using the Appwrite ID: `getUserByAppwriteId(session.user.id)`
2. Compare the database user's UUID with the chat's userId: `dbUser.id !== chat.userId`

This ensures we're comparing the correct user IDs and users can access their own chat histories.

## Changes Made

- Modified the ownership check in `app/(chat)/chat/[id]/page.tsx`
- Added proper user ID resolution for both the visibility check and readonly determination
- Imported `getUserByAppwriteId` function to resolve Appwrite IDs to database UUIDs

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Log in with your account
2. Navigate to the sidebar and click on any old chat history
3. The chat should now load successfully instead of showing a 404 error
4. You should be able to view and interact with your old conversations
