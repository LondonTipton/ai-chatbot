# âœ… Activation Complete!

## Status: LIVE ðŸš€

The intelligent routing system has been successfully activated!

## What Changed

### Files Modified

- âœ… `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Now using intelligent routing
- âœ… `app/(chat)/api/chat/route-backup.ts` - Original route backed up

### System Status

- âœ… Complexity detection: Active
- âœ… AI SDK routing: Active (simple, light queries)
- âœ… Mastra routing: Active (medium, deep, workflow queries)
- âœ… Tool call limits: Enforced (max 4 per agent)
- âœ… Streaming: Seamless via chatRoute()

## How to Test

### 1. Start Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Different Complexity Levels

Open your app and try these queries:

#### Simple (AI SDK + QNA) - Expected: 1-2s

```
"What is contract law?"
"Define intellectual property"
```

**Watch for**: `[Routing] ðŸ”µ Using AI SDK (simple)`

#### Light (AI SDK + Advanced Search) - Expected: 2-4s

```
"Explain property rights in Zimbabwe"
"Tell me about employment law"
```

**Watch for**: `[Routing] ðŸ”µ Using AI SDK (light)`

#### Medium (Mastra Agent) - Expected: 5-10s

```
"Find cases about labor disputes in Zimbabwe"
"What are recent developments in land reform?"
```

**Watch for**: `[Routing] ðŸŸ¢ Routing to Mastra (medium)`

#### Deep (Mastra Workflow) - Expected: 15-30s

```
"Compare precedents on intellectual property rights"
"Analyze case law on employment termination and extract key holdings"
```

**Watch for**: `[Routing] ðŸŸ¢ Routing to Mastra (deep)`

#### Workflow (Mastra Multi-Agent) - Expected: 10-20s

```
"Review this contract for legal compliance"
"Analyze this document and suggest improvements"
```

**Watch for**: `[Routing] ðŸŸ¢ Routing to Mastra (workflow)`

## Monitoring

### Watch Terminal Logs

You should see routing decisions like:

```
================================================================================
ðŸ”µ INTELLIGENT ROUTING CHAT ROUTE
================================================================================
[Routing] Query: "Find cases about labor disputes..."
[Routing] Complexity: medium
[Routing] Reasoning: Requires multiple search queries to gather comprehensive information
[Routing] Estimated steps: 3
[Routing] ðŸŸ¢ Routing to Mastra (medium)
```

### Key Indicators

| Indicator                          | Meaning                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”µ Using AI SDK                    | Simple/light query, fast response |
| ðŸŸ¢ Routing to Mastra               | Complex query, multi-step process |
| Active tools: tavilyQna            | Simple Q&A mode                   |
| Active tools: tavilyAdvancedSearch | Light research mode               |
| mediumResearchAgent                | Medium complexity agent           |
| deepResearchWorkflow               | Deep research workflow            |
| documentReviewWorkflow             | Document review workflow          |

## Performance Expectations

| Complexity | Response Time | Cost   | Route  |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Simple     | 1-2s          | $0.001 | AI SDK |
| Light      | 2-4s          | $0.002 | AI SDK |
| Medium     | 5-10s         | $0.005 | Mastra |
| Deep       | 15-30s        | $0.015 | Mastra |
| Workflow   | 10-20s        | $0.010 | Mastra |

## Troubleshooting

### If queries aren't routing correctly:

1. **Check logs** - Look for `[Routing]` messages
2. **Verify complexity** - Run `pnpm test:routing`
3. **Check Mastra agents** - Ensure all agents are registered

### If Mastra agents fail:

1. **Check environment variables**:

   ```bash
   # Verify these are set
   TAVILY_API_KEY=...
   CEREBRAS_API_KEY=...
   ```

2. **Verify agents are registered**:
   ```typescript
   // mastra/index.ts should have:
   agents: {
     mediumResearchAgent,
     searchAgent,
     extractAgent,
     analysisAgent,
   }
   ```

### If streaming breaks:

The new route uses `chatRoute()` to transform Mastra streams to AI SDK format. If you see streaming issues, check the console for errors.

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert to the original route:

```bash
# Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)

# Restore original route
Move-Item "app/(chat)/api/chat/route-backup.ts" "app/(chat)/api/chat/route-original.ts"
Move-Item "app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts" "app/(chat)/api/chat/route-with-routing.ts"
Move-Item "app/(chat)/api/chat/route-original.ts" "app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts"

# Restart
pnpm dev
```

## What's Next?

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try all complexity levels
2. **Monitor performance** - Watch response times and costs
3. **Gather feedback** - See how users respond
4. **Fine-tune** - Adjust complexity indicators if needed
5. **Scale** - Add new agents/workflows as needed

## Success Metrics

Your system is working correctly if:

âœ… Routing decisions match query complexity
âœ… Response times within expected ranges
âœ… Tool call limits respected (max 4 per agent)
âœ… Streaming works seamlessly
âœ… No increase in error rate
âœ… Users get better, more relevant responses
