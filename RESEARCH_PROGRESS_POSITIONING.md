# Research Progress UI - Positioning Fix

## Problem

The research progress UI was initially positioned at the bottom of the message list, making it invisible to users unless they scrolled down. This defeated the purpose of showing real-time progress.

## Solution

Moved the research progress component to a **sticky position at the top** of the viewport.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Sticky Positioning in `components/messages.tsx`

```tsx
{
  /* Fixed Research Progress at top */
}
{
  tools.length > 0 && (
    <div className="sticky top-0 z-20 mx-auto max-w-4xl px-2 pt-4 md:px-4">
      <ResearchProgress tools={tools} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key CSS classes:**

- `sticky top-0` - Sticks to the top of the scroll container
- `z-20` - Ensures it appears above other content
- `mx-auto max-w-4xl` - Centers and matches conversation width
- `px-2 pt-4 md:px-4` - Proper padding for mobile and desktop

#### 2. Enhanced Visual Styling in `components/research-progress.tsx`

```tsx
className =
  "mb-4 rounded-lg border border-border bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-sm shadow-lg p-4";
```

**Improvements:**

- `bg-background/95` - Semi-transparent background (95% opacity)
- `backdrop-blur-sm` - Blur effect for content behind it
- `shadow-lg` - Prominent shadow for depth
- Changed initial animation from `y: 10` to `y: -10` (slides down from top)

## User Experience

### Before

- Progress UI appeared at the bottom of messages
- Users had to scroll down to see it
- Appeared "dead" during research operations

### After

- Progress UI sticks to the top of the viewport
- Always visible during tool execution
- Slides down smoothly when tools start
- Fades out after completion
- Semi-transparent with blur effect for modern look

## Visual Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Sticky Research Progress]         │ ← Always visible at top
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Message 1                          │
│  Message 2                          │
│  Message 3                          │
│  ...                                │
│  [Scroll content]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technical Details

- **Position**: `sticky` with `top-0` keeps it at the top while scrolling
- **Z-index**: `z-20` ensures it's above messages but below modals
- **Backdrop**: Semi-transparent with blur creates depth without blocking content
- **Animation**: Slides down from top (`initial={{ y: -10 }}`) for natural appearance
- **Auto-dismiss**: Clears 3 seconds after all tools complete

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Users see progress instantly
2. **Persistent Feedback**: Stays visible while scrolling
3. **Non-Intrusive**: Semi-transparent design doesn't block content
4. **Professional Look**: Blur and shadow effects create polish
5. **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

## Future Considerations

- Could add option to minimize/collapse the progress UI
- Could position differently based on screen size
- Could add drag-to-reposition functionality
- Could show progress in browser tab title when not visible
