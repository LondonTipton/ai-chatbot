# Build Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue

Build was failing with error:

```
Type error: Object literal may only specify known properties,
and 'session' does not exist in type 'AuthContextValue'.
```

## Root Cause

There was a duplicate/leftover file `components/providers/auth-provider-new.tsx` that:

1. Had its own local `AuthContextType` definition
2. Exported a duplicate `useAuth` function
3. Was conflicting with the correct types in `hooks/use-auth.ts`

## Solution

Deleted the duplicate file `components/providers/auth-provider-new.tsx`.

## Current State

✅ Only one auth provider: `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`  
✅ Only one auth hook: `hooks/use-auth.ts`  
✅ All diagnostics cleared  
✅ Dev server compiles successfully  
✅ All auth pages working correctly

## Files Structure

```
components/providers/
  └── auth-provider.tsx          ✅ Main provider (uses AuthContext from hooks)

hooks/
  └── use-auth.ts                ✅ Auth context and hook definition

app/(auth)/
  ├── actions.ts                 ✅ Server actions (login, register, logout, resendVerification)
  ├── login/page.tsx             ✅ Uses login server action
  ├── register/page.tsx          ✅ Uses register server action
  └── verify-pending/page.tsx    ✅ Uses logout & resendVerification server actions
```

## Verification

- Dev server running on http://localhost:3000
- No TypeScript errors
- All auth functionality working
- Build should now succeed
