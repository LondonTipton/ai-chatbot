# Test Updates Summary - Task 11

## Overview

Updated all test files to reflect the authentication-only flow, removing all guest user and anonymous session functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. E2E Session Tests (`tests/e2e/session.test.ts`)

**Removed:**

- All guest session tests (guest authentication, guest user menu, guest upgrade prompts)
- Guest session creation redirect tests
- Guest user entitlement tests

**Added:**

- Unauthenticated access tests:
  - Redirect to login when accessing root without session
  - Redirect to login when accessing chat routes without session
  - Allow accessing login/register pages without session
  - Preserve returnUrl in login redirects
- New user registration and login tests:
  - Register new account and automatically log in
  - Fail to register with existing email
  - Log into existing account
  - Display user email in user menu
  - Redirect to returnUrl after login
  - Log out redirects to login page
  - Redirect authenticated users away from auth pages
- Returning user automatic login tests:
  - Automatically log in returning user with valid session
  - Maintain session across page navigation

### 2. Unit Auth Tests (`tests/unit/auth.test.ts`)

**Removed:**

- `createAnonymousSession()` tests
- `isAnonymousSession()` tests
- Anonymous session identification tests

**Updated:**

- Fixed test structure to use Playwright's `test` API correctly
- Removed imports for anonymous session functions
- Kept all email/password authentication tests

### 3. Integration Auth Actions Tests (`tests/integration/auth-actions.test.ts`)

**Removed:**

- All `upgradeGuest()` action tests
- Guest user creation and upgrade flow tests
- Anonymous session setup in tests

**Updated:**

- Fixed test structure to use Playwright's `test` API correctly
- Removed imports for guest-related functions
- Kept all register, login, and logout tests

### 4. Test Helper Updates (`tests/pages/auth.ts`)

**Updated:**

- `logout()` method no longer expects guest user state
- Logout now expects redirect to login page instead of guest session
- Removed guest-specific assertions

## Test Status

### Passing Tests (5/15)

✅ Unauthenticated access tests (all 5 tests passing)

- These tests verify that unauthenticated users are properly redirected to login

### Failing Tests (2/15)

❌ Register new account and automatically log in

- Times out waiting for redirect to home page after registration
- **Reason:** Registration may not be automatically creating session and redirecting

❌ Automatically log in returning user with valid session

- Times out during test fixture setup
- **Reason:** Test fixture creation may have issues with the new auth flow

### Skipped Tests (8/15)

⏭️ Tests dependent on successful registration/login

- These tests are skipped because they depend on the failing tests

## Requirements Coverage

The updated tests cover all requirements specified in task 11:

✅ **Requirement 1.1, 1.2:** Middleware redirects to login for unauthenticated users

- Tested in "Unauthenticated Access" test suite

✅ **Requirement 2.1:** Persistent sessions for returning users

- Tested in "Returning User Automatic Login" test suite

✅ **Requirement 4.4:** Registration automatically logs in user

- Tested in "New User Registration and Login" test suite

## Next Steps

The test failures indicate that some implementation tasks may not be fully complete:

1. **Task 6 (Login page returnUrl handling)** - May need verification
2. **Task 7 (Register page automatic login)** - May need verification
3. **Test fixtures** - May need updates for authentication-only flow

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E session tests
pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/session.test.ts

# Run unit auth tests
pnpm exec playwright test tests/unit/auth.test.ts

# Run integration auth action tests
pnpm exec playwright test tests/integration/auth-actions.test.ts

# Run all tests
pnpm test
```

## Notes

- All guest-related code has been removed from tests
- Tests now assume all users must be authenticated
- Tests verify proper redirect behavior for unauthenticated access
- Tests verify session persistence for returning users
- Test structure has been updated to use Playwright's test API correctly
