# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature removes guest user functionality from DeepCounsel and implements a mandatory authentication flow with persistent login sessions. Users will be required to create an account and log in before accessing the chat interface. The system will automatically log in returning users using secure session cookies.

## Glossary

- **Authentication System**: The Appwrite-based authentication service that manages user accounts and sessions
- **Session Cookie**: An HTTP-only secure cookie that stores the user's authentication session
- **Chat Interface**: The main conversational AI interface at the root route
- **Auth Routes**: Public routes for login, registration, and password reset (/login, /register, /reset-password)
- **Protected Routes**: Routes that require authentication, including the chat interface and all chat-related pages
- **Persistent Session**: A long-lived authentication session that survives browser restarts

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be redirected to the login page when I first visit the application, so that I can create an account or log in

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user navigates to the root URL, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access any chat route, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
3. THE Authentication System SHALL display the login page without requiring any additional navigation
4. THE Authentication System SHALL preserve the originally requested URL for post-login redirection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to be automatically logged in when I revisit the application, so that I don't have to enter my credentials every time

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in, THE Authentication System SHALL create a persistent session cookie with a minimum duration of 30 days
2. WHEN a user with a valid session cookie visits the application, THE Authentication System SHALL automatically authenticate the user without requiring login
3. WHEN a session cookie expires, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. THE Authentication System SHALL use HTTP-only and secure flags for all session cookies
5. WHEN a user's session is valid, THE Authentication System SHALL grant immediate access to the Chat Interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the guest user option removed, so that all users have proper accounts with saved history and preferences

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication System SHALL NOT provide any option to continue as a guest user
2. THE Authentication System SHALL NOT create anonymous sessions for unauthenticated users
3. THE Chat Interface SHALL NOT display any guest upgrade prompts or guest-related UI elements
4. THE Authentication System SHALL require email and password for all user accounts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the registration page from the login page, so that I can create a new account if I don't have one

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication System SHALL display a link to the registration page on the login page
2. WHEN a user clicks the registration link, THE Authentication System SHALL navigate to the registration page
3. THE Authentication System SHALL allow users to navigate between login and registration pages without losing form data
4. WHEN a user successfully registers, THE Authentication System SHALL automatically log them in and redirect to the Chat Interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all guest-related code removed from the codebase, so that the application is simpler and more maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication System SHALL NOT include any API routes for guest session creation
2. THE Authentication System SHALL NOT include any components for guest user prompts or upgrades
3. THE Authentication System SHALL NOT include any middleware logic for guest session handling
4. THE Authentication System SHALL remove all guest-related utility functions and types
5. THE Authentication System SHALL update all database queries to expect authenticated users only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to remain active across browser restarts, so that I can continue my work seamlessly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser, THE Authentication System SHALL maintain the user's authenticated session
2. THE Authentication System SHALL refresh session tokens before they expire to maintain continuous authentication
3. WHEN a session cannot be refreshed, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page with an appropriate message
4. THE Authentication System SHALL handle session refresh transparently without interrupting the user's workflow

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the option to log out and clear my session, so that I can secure my account on shared devices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication System SHALL provide a logout button in the user interface
2. WHEN a user clicks logout, THE Authentication System SHALL invalidate the session cookie immediately
3. WHEN a user logs out, THE Authentication System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. THE Authentication System SHALL clear all client-side authentication state upon logout
5. WHEN a user logs out, THE Authentication System SHALL prevent access to protected routes until re-authentication
