# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the DeepCounsel authentication system from Auth.js (NextAuth v5 beta) to Appwrite's email authorization service. The migration aims to leverage Appwrite's managed authentication infrastructure while maintaining existing user experience, guest user functionality, and chat history preservation.

## Glossary

- **Auth_System**: The authentication and authorization system responsible for user identity management
- **Appwrite_Service**: The Appwrite cloud platform providing managed authentication services
- **NextAuth_Provider**: The current Auth.js (NextAuth v5 beta) authentication library
- **Guest_User**: An unauthenticated user with temporary access to the application
- **Anonymous_Session**: Appwrite's native guest user implementation using temporary sessions
- **User_Session**: An authenticated state maintained by the authentication system
- **Migration_Script**: A utility that transfers existing user data to the new authentication system
- **Local_Database**: The PostgreSQL database storing user and chat data
- **Session_Cookie**: An HTTP cookie containing session authentication tokens
- **Email_Verification**: The process of confirming user email address ownership

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my personalized chat history and settings

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a registered user submits valid email and password credentials, THE Auth_System SHALL create an authenticated User_Session with Appwrite_Service
2. WHEN a registered user submits invalid credentials, THE Auth_System SHALL reject the login attempt and display an error message
3. WHEN a User_Session is created, THE Auth_System SHALL store the Session_Cookie in the user's browser
4. WHEN a logged-in user navigates to protected routes, THE Auth_System SHALL validate the Session_Cookie and grant access
5. WHEN a User_Session expires, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect the user to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with my email and password, so that I can create an account and save my chat history

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user submits registration with valid email and password, THE Auth_System SHALL create an account in Appwrite_Service
2. WHEN an account is created in Appwrite_Service, THE Auth_System SHALL store the Appwrite user ID in the Local_Database
3. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email, THE Auth_System SHALL reject the registration and display an error message
4. WHEN registration is successful, THE Auth_System SHALL automatically create a User_Session for the new user
5. WHERE Email_Verification is enabled, THE Auth_System SHALL send a verification email to the user's email address

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a guest user, I want to access the application without registration, so that I can try the service before committing to an account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses the application, THE Auth_System SHALL create an Anonymous_Session using Appwrite_Service
2. WHEN a Guest_User creates chat conversations, THE Auth_System SHALL associate the data with the Anonymous_Session identifier
3. WHEN a Guest_User decides to register, THE Auth_System SHALL convert the Anonymous_Session to a full account while preserving chat history
4. WHEN a Guest_User's Anonymous_Session expires, THE Auth_System SHALL create a new Anonymous_Session
5. WHILE a user has an Anonymous_Session, THE Auth_System SHALL display guest user indicators in the interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to log out of my account, so that I can secure my session on shared devices

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates logout, THE Auth_System SHALL delete the User_Session from Appwrite_Service
2. WHEN a User_Session is deleted, THE Auth_System SHALL remove the Session_Cookie from the user's browser
3. WHEN logout is complete, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
4. WHEN a logged-out user attempts to access protected routes, THE Auth_System SHALL create a new Anonymous_Session

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want existing user accounts migrated to Appwrite, so that users can continue accessing their accounts without disruption

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Migration_Script executes, THE Auth_System SHALL create corresponding Appwrite accounts for all existing users in the Local_Database
2. WHEN an Appwrite account is created during migration, THE Auth_System SHALL store the Appwrite user ID in the Local_Database user record
3. WHEN a migrated user logs in for the first time, THE Auth_System SHALL authenticate against Appwrite_Service using their credentials
4. IF a user's password cannot be migrated, THE Auth_System SHALL flag the account for password reset
5. WHEN migration is complete, THE Auth_System SHALL maintain all existing chat history associations with user accounts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to handle session validation in middleware, so that protected routes are automatically secured

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to a protected route, THE Auth_System SHALL validate the Session_Cookie using Appwrite_Service
2. WHEN a Session_Cookie is invalid or missing, THE Auth_System SHALL create an Anonymous_Session and redirect appropriately
3. WHEN a logged-in user accesses login or register pages, THE Auth_System SHALL redirect them to the home page
4. WHEN middleware validates a session, THE Auth_System SHALL attach user information to the request context
5. WHILE processing authentication checks, THE Auth_System SHALL complete validation within 200 milliseconds to maintain performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to persist across browser sessions, so that I don't have to log in repeatedly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a User_Session is created, THE Auth_System SHALL configure the Session_Cookie with appropriate expiration time
2. WHEN a user closes and reopens their browser, THE Auth_System SHALL restore the User_Session from the Session_Cookie
3. WHEN a Session_Cookie is about to expire, THE Auth_System SHALL refresh the session automatically
4. WHEN a user's session cannot be restored, THE Auth_System SHALL create a new Anonymous_Session
5. WHERE the user selected "remember me", THE Auth_System SHALL extend the Session_Cookie expiration to 30 days

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove NextAuth dependencies after migration, so that the codebase is simplified and maintainable

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete and tested, THE Auth_System SHALL remove all NextAuth_Provider package dependencies
2. WHEN NextAuth code is removed, THE Auth_System SHALL delete unused authentication configuration files
3. WHEN cleanup is complete, THE Auth_System SHALL update all import statements to reference Appwrite utilities
4. WHEN the codebase is cleaned, THE Auth_System SHALL update documentation to reflect the new authentication approach
5. WHEN all changes are applied, THE Auth_System SHALL pass all existing end-to-end authentication tests

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my password to be securely handled, so that my account remains protected

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers or logs in, THE Auth_System SHALL transmit credentials over HTTPS connections only
2. WHEN Appwrite_Service stores passwords, THE Auth_System SHALL ensure passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms
3. WHEN authentication fails, THE Auth_System SHALL not reveal whether the email or password was incorrect
4. WHEN a user attempts multiple failed logins, THE Auth_System SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
5. WHERE password reset is requested, THE Auth_System SHALL send a secure reset link with time-limited validity

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for authentication operations, so that users receive clear feedback and issues are logged

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication operation fails, THE Auth_System SHALL return user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN a network error occurs with Appwrite_Service, THE Auth_System SHALL retry the operation up to 3 times
3. WHEN an unrecoverable error occurs, THE Auth_System SHALL log the error details for debugging
4. WHEN Appwrite_Service is unavailable, THE Auth_System SHALL display a maintenance message to users
5. WHEN an error is logged, THE Auth_System SHALL include request context, user ID (if available), and timestamp
