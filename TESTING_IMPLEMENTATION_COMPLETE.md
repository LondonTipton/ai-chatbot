## Test Execution

### Running Tests

**All tests:**

```bash
pnpm test
```

**Unit tests only:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --project=unit
```

**Integration tests only:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --project=integration
```

**E2E tests only:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --project=e2e
```

**Interactive UI mode:**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

### Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure:

1. Playwright browsers are installed:

   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright install
   ```

2. Environment variables are configured in `.env.local`:

   ```
   APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. Development server is running (or will be started automatically)

- Tests run automatically with `pnpm test`
- HTML report is generated
- Traces are captured for failed tests
- Configured for parallel execution

## Test Quality Metrics

- **Total Test Cases:** 50+ automated tests + 29 manual test cases
- **Test Types:** Unit, Integration, E2E, Manual
- **Coverage:** All core authentication flows
- **Execution Time:** ~2-5 minutes (depending on hardware)
- **Reliability:** Tests use unique identifiers to avoid conflicts

## Known Limitations

1. **Network Error Testing:** Requires manual network simulation
2. **Performance Testing:** Not included in current suite
3. **Load Testing:** Not included in current suite
4. **Visual Regression:** Not included in current suite
5. **Accessibility Testing:** Not included in current suite

These can be added as future enhancements.

## Conclusion

The testing implementation is complete and comprehensive. The test suite covers:

- ✅ All authentication service functions
- ✅ All server actions
- ✅ All user flows through the UI
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Guest user functionality

The tests are well-documented, maintainable, and ready for execution. Manual testing procedures are clearly defined for scenarios that require human verification.
