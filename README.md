## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of DeepCounsel to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot&env=AUTH_SECRET&envDescription=Learn+more+about+how+to+get+the+API+Keys+for+the+application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fai-chatbot%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=AI+Chatbot&demo-description=An+Open-Source+AI+Chatbot+Template+Built+With+Next.js+and+the+AI+SDK+by+Vercel.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fchat.vercel.ai&products=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22ai%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22grok%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22xai%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22neon%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22integration%22%2C%22protocol%22%3A%22storage%22%2C%22productSlug%22%3A%22upstash-kv%22%2C%22integrationSlug%22%3A%22upstash%22%7D%2C%7B%22type%22%3A%22blob%22%7D%5D)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run DeepCounsel. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Authentication Setup

DeepCounsel uses [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) for authentication. Follow these steps to set up authentication:

### 1. Create an Appwrite Project

1. Go to [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) and create a free account
2. Create a new project
3. Copy your Project ID from Settings > General

### 2. Configure Authentication

1. Navigate to **Auth** in your Appwrite project
2. Enable **Email/Password** authentication
3. Enable **Anonymous Sessions** (for guest users)
4. Configure session limits and security settings as needed

### 3. Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Create a new API key with the following scopes:
   - `users.read`
   - `users.write`
3. Copy the API key (you won't be able to see it again)

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Authentication Features

- **Guest Users**: Unauthenticated users can access the app with anonymous sessions
- **Registration**: Users can create accounts with email and password
- **Login**: Registered users can log in with their credentials
- **Guest Upgrade**: Guest users can upgrade to full accounts while preserving chat history
- **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and validation

For more details on the authentication migration, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).
