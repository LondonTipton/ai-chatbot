# Email Verification Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Email verification has been successfully integrated into DeepCounsel. Users must now verify their email addresses before accessing the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Authentication (`components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`)

- ✅ Added automatic verification email sending during registration
- ✅ Added `resendVerification()` method for users to request new emails
- ✅ Updated context to expose new functionality

### 2. Type Definitions (`hooks/use-auth.ts`)

- ✅ Added `resendVerification` to AuthContextValue interface

### 3. Middleware Protection (`middleware.ts`)

- ✅ Added `/verify` and `/verify-pending` to public routes
- ✅ Implemented server-side email verification check
- ✅ Redirects unverified users to `/verify-pending`
- ✅ Prevents verified users from accessing verification pages
- ✅ Adds `x-email-verified` header to requests

### 4. New Pages Created

#### `/verify` - Email Verification Handler

- Extracts `userId` and `secret` from URL query parameters
- Calls Appwrite's verification API
- Shows loading, success, and error states
- Auto-redirects to home on success
- Provides option to resend on failure

#### `/verify-pending` - Verification Reminder

- Shows user's email address
- Explains verification requirement
- Provides "Resend Verification Email" button
- Provides "Sign Out" button
- Shows helpful tips and information

### 5. Registration Flow Update (`app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Changed post-registration redirect from `/` to `/verify-pending`
- ✅ Updated success message to mention email verification

## How It Works

### New User Registration

```
Register → Auto-login → Send verification email → Redirect to /verify-pending
```

### Email Verification

```
Click email link → /verify?userId=...&secret=... → Verify → Redirect to home
```

### Access Control

```
Request protected route → Middleware checks emailVerification →
  If false: redirect to /verify-pending
  If true: allow access
```

## Security

- ✅ Server-side enforcement via middleware
- ✅ Cannot bypass verification through client manipulation
- ✅ Verification tokens expire after 1 hour
- ✅ Users can request new tokens
- ✅ Session validation includes verification status

## User Experience

### For Unverified Users

1. Register account
2. See "verify your email" page
3. Check email inbox
4. Click verification link
5. Get redirected to app with full access

### For Verified Users

- Normal login flow
- Full access to all features
- No interruptions

## Configuration Required

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For production:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Appwrite Setup

1. **SMTP Configuration**

   - Configure email service in Appwrite Console
   - Settings → SMTP

2. **Platform Configuration**

   - Add your domain to Platforms
   - Required for redirect URLs to work

3. **Email Templates** (Optional)
   - Customize verification email template
   - Auth → Templates → Email Verification

## Testing

### Quick Test

1. Register a new account
2. Check that you're redirected to `/verify-pending`
3. Check your email for verification link
4. Click the link
5. Verify you're redirected to home with access

### Development Tips

- Check Appwrite Console to see user verification status
- Use Mailtrap or similar for email testing
- Review middleware logs for debugging

## Files Reference

### Modified Files

- `components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`
