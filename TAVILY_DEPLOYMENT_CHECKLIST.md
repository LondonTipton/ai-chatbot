## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Local)

Run these tests before deploying:

#### 1. Basic Search

```
Test: "Search for Zimbabwe Constitution property rights"
Expected: Returns search results with URLs
Status: [ ]
```

#### 2. Advanced Search

```
Test: "Do a thorough search for Bowers v. Minister of Lands case"
Expected: Uses advanced search depth, returns comprehensive results
Status: [ ]
```

#### 3. Domain Filtering

```
Test: "Search only government sites for Labour Act"
Expected: Filters to .gov.zw domains
Status: [ ]
```

#### 4. Content Extraction

```
Test: "Find the full text of [case from search results]"
Expected: Extracts content and creates document
Status: [ ]
```

#### 5. Multi-Tool Workflow

```
Test: "Find and summarize the Brown v. Board case"
Expected: Search → Extract → Create 2 documents (full text + summary)
Status: [ ]
```

#### 6. Error Handling

```
Test: Temporarily remove TAVILY_API_KEY and try search
Expected: Clear error message, graceful fallback
Status: [ ]
```

#### 7. Empty Results

```
Test: "Search for nonexistent case xyz123abc"
Expected: Handles empty results gracefully
Status: [ ]
```

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run integration tests
pnpm test lib/ai/tools/__tests__/tavily-integration.test.ts

# Expected: All tests pass
Status: [ ]
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Vercel Environment Variables

- [ ] Go to Vercel project settings
- [ ] Navigate to Environment Variables
- [ ] Add `TAVILY_API_KEY` with value from `.env.local`
- [ ] Apply to: Production, Preview, Development
- [ ] Save changes

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Option 1: Push to main branch (auto-deploy)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Tavily extract tool and enhanced search integration"
git push origin main

# Option 2: Manual deploy
vercel --prod
```

- [ ] Deployment initiated
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Deployment URL received

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Test on Production

- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Start new chat
- [ ] Test basic search: "Search for Zimbabwe Constitution"
- [ ] Test extraction: "Find the full text of [result]"
- [ ] Test document creation: "Find and summarize [case]"
- [ ] Verify artifacts are created correctly
- [ ] Check tool usage indicators appear
- [ ] Verify source URLs are shown

#### Check Logs

- [ ] Open Vercel deployment logs
- [ ] Look for any Tavily-related errors
- [ ] Verify API calls are successful
- [ ] Check response times are acceptable

#### Monitor API Usage

- [ ] Visit https://app.tavily.com/dashboard
- [ ] Verify API calls are being logged
- [ ] Check credit usage is reasonable
- [ ] Set up usage alerts if available

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Week 1: Active Monitoring

- [ ] Day 1: Check for errors in Vercel logs
- [ ] Day 1: Verify API usage in Tavily dashboard
- [ ] Day 3: Review user feedback
- [ ] Day 7: Analyze usage patterns
- [ ] Day 7: Check credit consumption rate

### Ongoing Monitoring

- [ ] Set up weekly API usage review
- [ ] Monitor error rates in Vercel
- [ ] Track user satisfaction
- [ ] Review credit consumption monthly
- [ ] Plan for scaling if needed

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

### Quick Rollback

1. **Disable tools temporarily:**

   ```typescript
   // In app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts
   experimental_activeTools: [
     "getWeather",
     "createDocument",
     "updateDocument",
     "requestSuggestions",
     // "tavilySearch",      // Comment out
     // "tavilyExtract",     // Comment out
   ];
   ```

2. **Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git commit -am "fix: Temporarily disable Tavily tools"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Full Rollback

1. **Revert to previous commit:**

   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or rollback in Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Find previous deployment
   - Click "Promote to Production"

## Success Criteria

## Support Preparation

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: "Search not working"**

- Check: TAVILY_API_KEY in Vercel
- Check: API key is valid
- Check: Rate limits not exceeded

**Issue 2: "Extraction failed"**

- Check: URL is accessible
- Try: Different URL from results
- Try: Advanced extraction depth

**Issue 3: "Rate limit exceeded"**

- Check: Usage in Tavily dashboard
- Solution: Wait for monthly reset
- Solution: Upgrade plan if needed

### Escalation Path

1. Check Vercel logs
2. Check Tavily dashboard
