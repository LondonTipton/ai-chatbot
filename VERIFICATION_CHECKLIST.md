## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Configure Appwrite Email Service

Before testing, you need to set up email delivery in Appwrite:

1. **Go to Appwrite Console**

   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to Settings → SMTP

2. **Configure SMTP Settings**

   - Option A: Use Appwrite's default email service (easiest)
   - Option B: Configure your own SMTP server
   - Option C: Use a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.

3. **Test Email Delivery**
   - Send a test email from Appwrite Console
   - Verify it arrives in your inbox

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` has:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### 3. Add Platform in Appwrite

1. Go to Appwrite Console → Your Project → Settings → Platforms
2. Add a new Web Platform
3. Set the hostname to:
   - Development: `localhost`
   - Production: `yourdomain.com`

This allows verification redirect URLs to work properly.

### 4. Test the Flow

#### Test Registration

1. Start your dev server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to `/register`
3. Create a new account
4. Verify you're redirected to `/verify-pending`
5. Check your email for verification link

#### Test Verification

1. Click the verification link in email
2. Verify you're redirected to `/verify` page
3. See success message
4. Get redirected to home page
5. Confirm you can access protected routes

#### Test Resend

1. On `/verify-pending` page
2. Click "Resend Verification Email"
3. Check for new email
4. Verify new link works

#### Test Access Control

1. Try accessing home page without verification
2. Verify redirect to `/verify-pending`
3. After verification, confirm access is granted

### 5. Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. **Update Environment Variable**

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **Add Production Platform**

   - Add your production domain to Appwrite Platforms

3. **Test Email Delivery**

   - Verify emails are sent in production
   - Check spam folders if needed

4. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check middleware logs for verification checks
   - Monitor Appwrite logs for email delivery

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

**Problem**: Users not receiving verification emails

**Solutions**:

1. Check SMTP configuration in Appwrite Console
2. Verify email service is enabled
3. Check Appwrite logs for errors
4. Test with a different email provider
5. Check spam/junk folders

### Verification Link Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking link shows error

**Solutions**:

1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is correct
2. Check domain is added to Platforms in Appwrite
3. Ensure link hasn't expired (1 hour limit)
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Try resending verification email

### Redirect Loops

**Problem**: User stuck in redirect loop

**Solutions**:

1. Clear browser cookies
2. Check middleware logs
3. Verify user status in Appwrite Console
4. Check for conflicting middleware logic

### User Can't Access App

**Problem**: Verified user still can't access protected routes

**Solutions**:

1. Check user verification status in Appwrite Console
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Log out and log back in
4. Check middleware logs for verification check
5. Verify middleware is checking `emailVerification` correctly

## Testing Checklist

Before considering this feature complete, test:

- [ ] New user registration sends verification email
- [ ] User is redirected to `/verify-pending` after registration
- [ ] Verification email contains correct link
- [ ] Clicking verification link verifies email
- [ ] Verified user can access protected routes
- [ ] Unverified user cannot access protected routes
- [ ] Resend verification email works
- [ ] Expired verification links show error
- [ ] Already verified users can't access verification pages
- [ ] Logout works from verification pending page
- [ ] Middleware enforces verification on all protected routes

## Optional Enhancements

Consider implementing these features later:

1. **Grace Period** - Allow limited access before requiring verification
2. **Email Change** - Require re-verification when email changes
3. **Admin Override** - Allow admins to manually verify users
4. **Verification Reminder** - Send reminder emails after 24 hours
5. **Rate Limiting** - Limit verification email requests
6. **Analytics** - Track verification completion rates
